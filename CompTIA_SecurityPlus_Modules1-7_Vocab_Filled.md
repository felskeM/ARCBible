# CompTIA Security+ Info Sec 1 Vocab Sheet (Filled-In)

## Mod 1: Intro to Security
- **Security:** The state of being free from danger; in IT, it's the measures taken to protect digital systems from threats, often requiring trade-offs with convenience.
- **CIA TRIAD:**
  - **Confidentiality:** Ensures only approved individuals have access to data.
  - **Integrity:** Ensures information is accurate and has not been altered.
  - **Availability:** Ensures that authorized users can access data when needed.
- **Threat Actors:**
  - **Script Kiddies:** Inexperienced individuals who use pre-written tools to launch attacks without fully understanding how they work.
  - **Hacktivists:** Attackers motivated by political or ideological beliefs who aim to cause disruption or spread messages.
  - **State Actors:** Government-sponsored hackers, often involved in long-term, sophisticated attacks targeting national security or economic data.
  - **Insiders:** Authorized users (employees, partners) who intentionally or unintentionally misuse access to compromise systems.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Legacy Platforms:** Outdated hardware/software systems no longer receiving security updates, making them easy targets for attacks.
  - **Misconfigurations:** Incorrect settings or failure to properly secure devices and systems, often leaving unintended access points.
  - **Third-Party Risks:** Vulnerabilities introduced via contractors or suppliers connected to your systems (e.g., outsourced code, hosted storage).
  - **Patch Management:** The process of updating software to fix known vulnerabilities; delays or failures in patching create risk.
  - **Zero-Day Vulnerability:** A flaw unknown to the vendor, with no patch available, making it highly exploitable by attackers.
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - **Email:** Phishing emails, attachments, or malicious links are common methods attackers use to compromise systems.
  - **Social Media:** Used for social engineering, gathering intel, or spreading malicious links through impersonation or fake accounts.
- **Social Engineering:**
  - **Phishing / Vishing / Smishing:** Methods of tricking users into providing sensitive info—phishing via email, vishing via phone, smishing via SMS.
  - **Tailgating / Dumpster Diving / Shoulder Surfing:** Physical methods of social engineering—following someone into a secure area, retrieving data from trash, or observing someone’s screen/keyboard without permission.

## Mod 2: Threat Management and CyberSec Resources
- **Penetration Testing:** A controlled attack simulation that attempts to exploit system vulnerabilities to assess security defenses. Often manual, with deep testing mimicking threat actor behavior.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** An automated, ongoing process that identifies known vulnerabilities in systems by comparing them against a database of threats.
- **Reconnaissance:** The first phase in a penetration test; involves gathering information about the target, either actively (scanning) or passively (OSINT).
- **Creep:** The unintentional expansion of a pen test’s scope beyond its agreed boundaries, often due to poor planning, which can lead to legal and operational issues.
- **Rules of Engagement:** Formal guidelines set before a pen test that define its scope, timing, targets, authorization, communication, exploitation limits, cleanup procedures, and reporting requirements.
- **SIEM / SOAR:**
  - **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Collects, aggregates, and correlates security data (logs, alerts) to detect threats and support analysis.
  - **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):** Builds on SIEM by automating responses to security alerts, integrating broader data sources, and coordinating incident handling.
- **Threat Hunting:** A proactive process of searching for cyber threats that have evaded existing security tools, assuming attackers may already be inside the network.
- **Frameworks / Benchmarks / Standards:**
  - **Frameworks:** Structured guidelines for implementing cybersecurity best practices (e.g., NIST, ISO, CIS).
  - **Benchmarks:** Vendor-specific configuration recommendations to secure systems against known threats.
  - **Standards:** Industry-recognized rules and protocols that define security practices, such as PCI DSS for payment systems.
